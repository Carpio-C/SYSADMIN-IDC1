# SYSADM1 -- Capacity Management & Planning

**Part 2. Network Scalability Analysis**

Recall the e-commerce website scenario we discussed earlier. Given the
expected surge in traffic, analyze the provided network topology
diagram. Identify potential bottlenecks and areas where scalability
might be a concern. Propose specific strategies to improve the
network\'s scalability and performance to ensure a seamless user
experience during the peak traffic period. Consider factors such as
increased user demand, new applications, and security threats.

height="3.8229166666666665in"}

Potential Bottlenecks:

Edge Router Capacity- A single edge router processes all incoming and
outgoing traffic. During peak traffic, this may lead to network
slowdowns, dropped connections, and downtime if the router fails.

Core Switch- No redundancy, the entire network could fail if this switch
becomes unresponsive.

VLAN's - Imbalanced traffic and underutilized resources across VLANs.

No security measure- making the network vulnerable to external threats.

Proposed Strategies:

-   We added 1 more core router so that the network can handle more
    traffic and provides availability. Also, if one router fails, the
    other router takes over seamlessly.

-   We also added 1 more core switch for enhanced scalability,
    redundancy, and faster inter-VLAN communication.

-   Load balancers were implemented within each VLAN to ensure even
    distribution of incoming traffic.

-   Added firewall with IDS/IPS to monitor all incoming and outgoing
    traffic, filters malicious requests, and mitigates potential threats
    in real-time.

-   We also added a monitoring system to track real-time performance
    metrics, detect anomalies, and provide alerts for security threats
